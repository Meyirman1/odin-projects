  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p> The preparation starts with cooked short-grain rice, which can be prepared specifically for omurice or used from the day before. Then, finely chopped onions and other vegetables, such as carrots, cabbage, and peppers, are stir-fried in a skillet with some finely chopped chicken or other meat. The mixture is seasoned with salt, pepper, and tomato ketchup, and the cooked rice is then stirred in, so it absorbs all the flavors.
  The rice is then set aside and, often in the same pan, a single-portion omelet is prepared. It can be filled with rice or served on top of it, and the preparation is finished with a dollop of ketchup, demi-glace or other sauce.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The main rule of thumb when it comes to eggs for omurice is not to over-whisk them.</li>
      <li>It is enough to break the eggs into a bowl and gently stir them with chopsticks, so the egg yolks and the egg whites are just combined.</li>
      <li>Each portion, consisting of one or two eggs, is fried separately in hot vegetable oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Small, round grain, sushi rice is the best option for omurice because it absorbs the flavors perfectly.</li>
      <li>The rice can be freshly cooked or used as a leftover from the day before in which case, the clumps should be broken down gently using your fingers.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Sauce</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Typically, homemade omurice is made with classic tomato ketchup, which is added to the rice during frying, and drizzled over the omelet before serving. </li>
      <li>Sometimes, ketchup can be accompanied with mayonnaise, most commonly of Kewpie brand which is slightly thinner than regular mayonnaise.</li>
      <li>This approach is common in small, neighborhood eateries, while more ambitious restaurants serve omurice with demi-glace.</li>
